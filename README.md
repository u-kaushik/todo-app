# Todo-app
A todo app built in React

My first attempt at building a project in React.js. Aim was to create a todo app that could create, update and delete entries using a functional component design. 
I followed along a tutorial on Youtube from @briancodex & his project build. (See references for video & code).

# Changes I made
1 - Added a success icon to each 'Todo' which linked to the 'completeTodo' function.

2 - Styling edits in CSS

# Improvements to make
1 - Linking app to a database for storage

2 - Creating a prompt function before deleting

3 - Allowing multiple ways to sort
